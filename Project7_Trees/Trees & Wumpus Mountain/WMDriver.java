/*
 * WMDriver
 * 
 * This contains a few lines of code to start things off.  Once you have made a
 * WumpusHunter subclass by extending the WumpusHunter class, you'll need to 
 * change the (currently broken) line of code so that it creates an object of your new
 * class.  
 * 
 * The other interesting thing here is to change the MountainFactory from a Binary Tree
 * to a 3-nary (Tertiary) Tree by commenting out the BinaryMountainFactory line and uncommenting
 * the TertiaryMountainFactory line below.  Note too you can make your own Factories for this exercise!
 * 
 * 
 * @Modified by: Sandy Chau
 * @Edits::  I commented out the import as it made the driver not work. I also did not 
 * create a new mountain. Otherwise the driver is the same
 *
